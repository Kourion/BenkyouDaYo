  "body": "# Japonicum\r\nCollection of all things grammar, and especially everything talked about in そとむら先生の日本語の授業.  \r\nAdditional info is provided and marked with the ¥(円) symbol, while helpful these parts are less relevant.  \r\n--> Sorted into Semesters 1,2 and 3\r\n\r\n# NaAdjectives\r\nEntails a list of lots of na-adjectives. (There are propably plenty missing, help finding them would be appreciated.)\r\n\r\n# Landeskunde\r\nThis is a LaTeX version of all my notes from our 日本文化地理概論. Hopefully kept up to date every week starting soon, it currently especially lacks the first couple of lessons. Also some dates and statistics as presented by そとむら are either completly untrue or simply outdated as such i often provide the true facts in parenthesis right next to them. (Though for the exam one might want to go with そとむら's view of the world.)\r\n\r\n# Landeskunde Vocabulary\r\nPretty self explanatory, it contains all the Vocabs we get mailed every so often.   \r\nNaturally with supportive ひらがな or ふりがな, and proper translation.\r\n\r\n# ANKI Vocabulary\r\nThe vocabulary in form of anki study cards is to be found at: (coming soon)\r\n",
