  "body": "# [日本学](/JaponicumSemester3.pdf)\r\nCollection of all things grammar, and especially everything talked about in そとむら先生の日本語の授業.  \r\nAdditional info is provided and marked with the ¥(円) symbol if that info was never given by そと, while helpful these parts are less relevant.  \r\n--> Sorted into Semesters 1(TODO), Semester 2(TODO) and [Semester 3](/JaponicumSemester3.pdf)(UpToDateAsOf 12.Dec.2016)\r\n\r\n## [日本学 Vocabulary](/JaponicumVocabulary.pdf) \r\nFor those cases where anki is not suited, a fine list of all new vocabulary instead.  \r\n(UpToDateAsOf 12.Dec.16)\r\n\r\n# [日本文化地理概論](/Landeskunde.pdf)\r\nThis is a LaTeX version of all my notes from our 日本文化地理概論. Also some dates and statistics as presented by そとむら are either outdated or biased i sometimes provide additional information in parenthesis right next to them.  \r\n(Though for the exam one might want to go with そとむら's view of the world.)  \r\n\r\nHopefully kept up to date every week starting soon, it currently lacks the first couple of lessons.  \r\n(Contains currently lections 4(society),5(education),6(economy) and 7(culture). /Missing: 1(nature),2(politics),3(diplomacy))\r\n\r\n## [日本文化地理概論 Vocabulary](/LandeskundeVocabulary.pdf)\r\nPretty self explanatory, it contains all the Vocabs we get mailed every so often in form of some very nice tables.  \r\nNaturally with supportive ひらがな or ふりがな, and proper translation.  \r\n(Contains currently lections 1-8. /Missing: none  || UpToDateAsOf 12.Dec.16)\r\n\r\n# ANKI Vocabulary\r\nThe vocabulary in form of anki study cards:\r\n### [ANKI Language Course Vocabulary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9AJAgnr7rueWGV6Rnl5VTV0Nzg \"Download\")\r\nUpToDateAsOf 12.Dec.2016\r\n### ANKI Katakana Collection\r\nTODO\r\n### ANKI 日本文化地理概論 Vocabulary\r\nContains clases 1-3. /Missing 4-7\r\n### How to use the ANKI decks properly:  \r\nDownload the .apkg files from the links above and import them into Anki Desktop.  \r\nRinse and repeat on days following lectures or vocabulary emails, by then the new versions should be up. \r\n\r\nBut wait! Won't I loose my studying progress everytime I download the deck anew?  \r\nNo! Anki is smart enough to compare your already existing decks with your current imports, as long as the cards are not entirely turned upside down(which they hopefully won't be), this means cards will only be imported if they are entirely new, otherwise only changes will be adopted keeping your scheduling.  \r\n\r\n# [NaAdjectives](/NaAdjectives.pdf)\r\nEntails a list of lots of na-adjectives. (There are propably plenty missing, help finding them would be appreciated.)\r\n\r\n# [Random Vocabulary](/RandomVocabulary.pdf) \r\nWords which i pick up here and there from one 日本人 or another. Please note the randomness factor here is unusually large.\r\n",
