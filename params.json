(There are propably plenty missing, so help to find them is more than welcome.)\r\n\r\n# Landeskunde\r\nThis is a LaTeX version of all my notes from our 日本文化地理概論. Some dates and statistics as presented by そとむら are either completly untrue or simply outdated as such i sometimes provide the facts i researched in parenthesis right next to them. (Though for the exam one might want to go with そとむら's view of the world.)\r\n\r\n# Landeskunde Vocabulary\r\nPretty self explanatory, it contains all the Vocabs we get mailed every so often.   \r\nNaturally with supportive ひらがな or ふりがな, and proper translation.\r\n\r\n# ANKI Vocabulary\r\nThe vocabulary in form of anki study cards is to be found at: (coming soon)\r\n",
