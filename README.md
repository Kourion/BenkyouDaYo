# BenkyouDaYo
日本語の勉強をしの道具.

# Japonicum
Collection of all things grammar, and especially everything talked about in the language course. Additional info is provided and marked with the YEN symbol, while helpful these parts can be skipped when preparing for an exam.

# Japonicum Vocabs and Adjectives
Contains a rapidly changing collection of Vocabulary which has not been included in the Anki-Card collection. Once included there i will remove it from this file.
Also entails a list of all na-adjectives we are supposed to know of (though that one is currently far from up to date).

# Landeskunde
This is a LaTeX version of all my notes from our 日本文化地理概論. Hopefully kept up to date every week starting soon, it currently especially lacks the first couple of lessons. Also some dates and statistics as presented by そとむら are either completly untrue or simply outdated as such i often provide the true facts in parenthesis right next to them. (Though for the exam one might want to go with そとむら's view on the world.)

# Landeskunde Vocabulary
Pretty self explanatory, it contains all the Vocabs we get mailed every so often. Naturally with supportive ひらがな or ふりがな, and proper translation. Translations are mainly taken from jisho.org.

# RandomStuff
Feel free to ignore this one!
This one is as random as it gets, its a collection of things i want to keep track of and might be added to other files after considerable amounts of review and revision.
Also contains other completely unrelevant notes mostly for myself.
Again really boring stuff here.
