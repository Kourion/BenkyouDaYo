# [Japonicum](/JaponicumSemester3.pdf)
Collection of all things grammar, and especially everything talked about in そとむら先生の日本語の授業.  
Additional info is provided and marked with the ¥(円) symbol if that info was never given by そと, while helpful these parts are less relevant.  
--> Sorted into Semesters 1(TODO), Semester 2(TODO) and [Semester 3](/JaponicumSemester3.pdf)(UpToDateAsOf 30.11.2016)  

# [Landeskunde](/Landeskunde.pdf)
This is a LaTeX version of all my notes from our 日本文化地理概論. Also some dates and statistics as presented by そとむら are either outdated or biased i sometimes provide additional information in parenthesis right next to them.  
(Though for the exam one might want to go with そとむら's view of the world.)  

Hopefully kept up to date every week starting soon, it currently especially lacks the first couple of lessons.  
(Contains currently lections 4(society),5(education) and 6(economy). /Missing: 1(nature),2(politics),3(diplomacy))

# [Landeskunde Vocabulary](/LandeskundeVocabulary.pdf)
Pretty self explanatory, it contains all the Vocabs we get mailed every so often.  
Naturally with supportive ひらがな or ふりがな, and proper translation.
(Contains currently lections 1-7. /Missing: none)

UpToDate(Ish)AsOf 01.DEC.2016
### ANKI Katakana Collection
TODO
### ANKI Landeskunde Vocabulary
Contains clases 1-2. /Missing 4-7
### How to use the ANKI decks properly:  
Download the .apkg files from the links above and import them into Anki Desktop. Rinse and repeat on days following lectures or vocabulary emails, by then the new versions should be up. 

But wait! Won't i loose my studying progress everytime i download the deck anew?  
No! Anki is smart enough to compare your already existing decks with your current imports, as long as the cards are not entirely turned upside down(which they hopefully won't be), this means cards will only be imported if they areentirely new, otherwise only changes will be adopted keeping your scheduling.  


# [NaAdjectives](/NaAdjectives.pdf)
Entails a list of lots of na-adjectives. (There are propably plenty missing, help finding them would be appreciated.)
