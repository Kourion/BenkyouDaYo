# ANKI Vocabulary
The vocabulary in form of anki study cards:
### [ANKI Language Course Vocabulary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9AJAgnr7rueUGJkdTZuMkU4OVE "Download")
UpToDateAsOf 18.Dec.2016
### ANKI Katakana Collection
Part of the [ANKI Language Course Vocabulary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9AJAgnr7rueUGJkdTZuMkU4OVE "Download"), can be studied individually through filtering for the tag カタカナ. Also contains all カタカナ文字 as notes. These can be trained seperately through filtering for the tag 文字.
### ANKI 日本文化地理概論 Vocabulary
Contains classes 1-9
### How to use the ANKI decks properly:  
Download the .apkg files from the links above and import them into Anki Desktop.  
Rinse and repeat on days following lectures or vocabulary emails, by then the new versions should be up. 

But wait! Won't I loose my studying progress everytime I download the deck anew?  
No! Anki is smart enough to compare your already existing decks with your current imports, as long as the cards are not entirely turned upside down(which they hopefully won't be), this means cards will only be imported if they are entirely new, otherwise only changes will be adopted keeping your scheduling.
